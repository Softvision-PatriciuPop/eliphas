# eliphas
Open Firefox profiles and enroll in experiments the fast way.

**Note:** The current version works on Linux and Windows only

# How it Works:

**Creating profiles without user.js:**

1. Place eliphas.py inside your Firefox root folder (where firefox.exe resides).
2. Double click on eliphas.py.
3. Enter the amount of desired profiles.
4. Hit Enter.

=> eliphas will automatically open multiple instances of Firefox. (One instance per created profile).

**Creating profiles with a user.js dependency:**

1. Place eliphas.py inside your Firefox root folder (where firefox.exe resides).
2. Place a user.js file in the same folder where eliphas.py resides.
3. Double click on eliphas.py.
4. Enter the amount of desired profiles.
5. Hit Enter.

=> eliphas will automatically open multiple instances of Firefox. (One instance per created profile). Each profile will listen to the given user.js file.
